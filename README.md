## Self-Reflection:
It is so hard, and a lot of things have happened before and during I was doing my project. I am so confused and this assignment is super conplicated. I really do not like this one. Even most of the things are working fine, but still couple code that do not do their work. But the animation is pretty easy. I took like 20 minutes to add two kind of animation. One is color change and another one is moving from left to right.

### How long it took me to finish this?
about 4 days totally
